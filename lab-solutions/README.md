This is the space used to add lab solutions for WADD May 2021 Cohort.
The names of the branches represent the name of the module (lecture)
in moodle that a particular lab solution belongs to.

For html-css solutions, include a folder with your name and in there include your lab solutions (.html/.css/readme.md files)
For javascript solutions, include a folder with the name of the module your lab solution belongs to, and in there add your solution.
For example: js-string -> greetings -> index.html/readme.md
