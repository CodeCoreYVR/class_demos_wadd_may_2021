        <h1><b>Clone This Page</b></h1>
        <p>The goal of this assignment is to replicate this page, to the best of your ability, without having seen the HTMLcode.</p>
        <p>The exercise will help you understand how to break a webpage into sections in your mind before creating the code, which will allow you to code much more efficently.</p>
        <ul>
            <p><u>Take note to replicate things like:</u></p>
            <li>size of headers in relation to other headers.</li>
            <li>the target value of links(they will state whether they open in new tab or not).</li>
            <li>ul vs ol dl list option, with list-type specifications</li>
          </ul>
