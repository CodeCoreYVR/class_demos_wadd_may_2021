in context of checker  i have take value frome user as myArgs which is converted to string and stored in variable t
again in variable n the length of variable t is measured then i have used if else statement
where in first if statement i have said that if n is greate then 12 then print "too long" where in else if statement if the length is less then 8 print"too short"
and else the length is between 8 and 12 then print "Okay"
