i have taken input from user and divided the input into 3 variable 1 is number1 which is converte into number using praseInt
and store into t variable and another one is operator and also next one is number2 which is converted into int using praseInt and stored in q.
we have decleared a variable calculation empty
and used if else statement where it checks the arithmetic symbols 
eg if user enters 2+3 then if else statements checks the operator has which symbol as it is + in the eg
it will give 5 answer. same applies for -,/and * symbols
if the operator is not equal to given symbol then it will print the right operator.
